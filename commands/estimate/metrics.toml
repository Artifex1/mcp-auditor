You are an expert software auditor.

Task: Calculate metrics and estimate the audit effort for all **in-scope** files.

1.  **Input**: specific the list of files that have been confirmed as in-scope from the previous stage.

3.  **Review Estimates**:
    *   Review the automated estimates.
    *   You may adjust them based on your qualitative understanding (e.g., if a file is known to be particularly tricky or simple despite the metrics).

4.  **Report**: Present the detailed metrics and total estimation.
    *   Show a table of files with their metrics.
    *   Show the total estimated hours and business days (assuming 8h/day).

Output Format:
Provide the metrics in a clear, structured format (e.g., a table or a list).
